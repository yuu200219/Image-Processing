# Histogram Equalization
## Introduction
Given two gray-level images, enhance the two given images by using the histogram equalization technique: (a) the global approach and (b) the local approach.
In the global approach, the histogram equalization technique is directly applied on each given image. In the local approach, each given image is partitioned into 16 “equal-sized” blocks, and then the histogram equalization technique is applied individually on the 16 “equal-sized” blocks.
